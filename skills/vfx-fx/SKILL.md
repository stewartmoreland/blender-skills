# VFX / FX

Readable effects. Controlled simulation domains. Game sprites vs cinematic volumes.

## When to Use

- Smoke, fire, dust, sparks, debris
- Magic / sci-fi energy FX
- Muzzle flashes, trails, impacts
- Geometry Nodes driven particle systems

## Path Decision

```
Game real-time → Meshes/cards/ribbons + emissive mats (+ GN)
Cinematic     → Mantaflow / particles / GN → render → comp
Hybrid        → Sim in Blender → bake flipbooks/meshes for engine
```

## Workflow

```
Brief (silhouette + timing) → Proxy emitter → Sim/GN prototype
  → Art-direct motion → Materials/lights → Cache → Render/comp or export
```

## Effect Types

| Type | Blender Approach |
|------|------------------|
| Smoke/fire | Mantaflow domain + flow; keep domain tight |
| Sparks | Particle Newtonian + collision + trail |
| Debris | Rigid body shards (`physics-sim`) |
| Magic ribbons | Curves / GN extrude + emissive |
| Dust hit | Short particle burst + soft sprites |

## Domain Rules (Volume)

- Domain only as large as needed
- Resolution from low → high after motion approved
- Open borders intentionally; avoid wasted empty voxels
- Collection: `COL_FX_[Shot]`

## Naming

- Emitters: `FX_Emit_[Name]`
- Domains: `FX_Domain_[Name]`
- Caches: document frame range in brief

## Game Export Notes

- Prefer mesh cards / GN instances over volume export
- Atlas flipbooks when baking fire/smoke for engines
- Keep pivot at logical spawn point

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Approve motion at low res before high-res sim
- Light FX intentionally (emissive + key)
- Cache before final render

### MUST NOT DO
- Huge empty domains
- Unbounded particle counts
- Skip timing brief (start/peak/end frames)
